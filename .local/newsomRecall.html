            <h1 class="bite-title">Newsom's Recall</h1>
            <p class='rus'>On September 14th, <b>Gavin Newsom</b>, California's Governor, was chosen to <b>not be
                    recalled</b> in a recall election. </p>
            <p class='rus'>Recall is purposed to <strong>remove corrupt elected officials</strong> from office and is a
                form of <strong>Direct Democracy</strong>, which is the <b>direct participation of citizens</b> in
                democratic decision making.</p>
            <p class='rus'> In California, there have been <b>179 recall attempts</b> and <b>6 actual recalls</b> of
                elected officials. Each 6 had to have enough <strong>signatures on a petition</strong> to recall,
                evaluation and affirmation of signatures from elections officials, and a <b>public vote</b>.</p>
            <p class='rus'>The recall against Democratic California Governor, Gavin Newsom, was caused by <strong>many
                    possible factors</strong>: Newsom’s stay at home orders, unemployment rates, the rising taxes from a
                shut-down economy, rising food and gas prices, the homeless crisis, and continuing wildfires.</p>
            <p class='rus'>Californians were <strong>mailed a ballot</strong> with two questions: A Yes/No question on
                whether Newsom should be removed and who should be the one to replace him. However, lots of candidates
                on the ballot could be problematic because a candidate could get <strong>less than 25%</strong> of votes
                and still <b>win</b>.</p>
            <p class='rus'>Despite the near <b>doubled ratio of Democrats to Republicans</b>, many Democrats were
                worried about possible <b>low Democratic voter turnout</b> compared to the <b>eager Republicans</b> and
                conservatives.</p>
            <p class='rus'>Democrats saw the recall as an effort from far-right <b>extremists and Trump supporters</b>
                to <b>attack</b> California’s <b>Progressive policies</b>, while <b>recall organizers</b> say they have
                support from <b>many groups</b>, including Democrats and many independents.</p>
            <p class='rus'><b>Newsom countered complaints</b> by announcing new spending programs, including $12 billion
                to <b>fight homelessness</b>, checks to millions of <b>citizens struggling with income</b>, and $2.7
                billion to pay for all of the state’s 4-year-old’s <b>kindergarten tuition</b>.</p>
            <p class='rus'>In the end, <b>64% of voters</b> voted to not recall Newsom and there was conversation about
                not <strong>“weaponizing” recalls</strong>, which resulted in backlash because many saw it as going
                against “the will of the people".</p>
