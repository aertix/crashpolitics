                            <h4>History</h4>
                            <p class='rus'>For centuries, the House of Representatives has been part of the branch of
                                government that has represented the will of the people of the United States of America.
                                It was formally established in 1789 as a result of the Great Compromise in 1787, in
                                which two plans were presented in an attempt to create a way to represent the people:
                                the New Jersey plan (proposed by William Patterson) and the Virginia plan (proposed by
                                Edmund Randolph). Finally, both sides agreed on the Great Compromise, which established
                                a two branch legislature called congress with two houses: the House of Representatives
                                and the senate. Each state would be assigned two senators, while the number of
                                representatives would be determined by the state’s population, with the number of
                                representatives changing every ten years based on the census (the official U.S. survey
                                taken every 10 years).

                            <p class='rus'>The House of Representatives (or “reps” for short) has extensive powers
                                granted by the Constitution, including the authority to initiate impeachment
                                proceedings, which are used to try and potentially remove someone from office or a
                                government position. They are also permitted to draft revenue (money) bills, and, in the
                                event of an electoral college tie, they have the power to elect the President of the
                                United States.

                            <p class='rus'>The Speaker of the House is one of the most important positions in the house.
                                This person leads the house debates and appoints members of the conference committee.
                                Furthermore, if both the President and the Vice President are unable to fulfill their
                                duties, the speaker has the power to become president.

                            <p class='rus'>Every two years, voters elect their state’s representatives. Our state of
                                California currently has 53 representatives because it is one of the most populous
                                states in the U.S., as opposed to Wyoming, which only has 19.
