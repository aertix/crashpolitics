                            <h4><b>History</b></h4>
                            <p class='rus'>The Judiciary act of 1789 established the court’s role in the federal
                                government; the Supreme Court has been in function ever since under the judiciary
                                branch. The Supreme Court held its first meeting in February of 1790. The first meetings
                                of the court were on organizational proceedings. In other words, justices came together
                                to discuss the steps to reach the court’s future goals. Their first case, West v.
                                Barnes, had to do with a money issue regarding a farmer who owed money to a family.
                                Their decision was that writs of error (appeals to a higher court that a lower court
                                made a mistake) can regularly be issued only from the clerk's office of the court.
