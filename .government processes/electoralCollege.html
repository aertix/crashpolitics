      <h1 class="bite-title">Electoral College </h1>
      <p class='rus'>A system used in the United States to <b>elect a president</b> every <b>4 years</b></p>
      <p class='rus'>Each state has a specific number of “electors” which is the sum of the number of house
        representatives and the number of senators. Example: California has 53 representatives in the house and
        2 senators, which means they get 55 electoral votes, (since the number of representatives in the House
        is determined by population size; California would have more electoral votes than Utah because its
        population is larger).
      </p>
      <p class='rus'> Each state holds elections and the candidate who receives the most votes in a state receives
        the electoral votes from that state. Example: If the majority of Californians vote for a democratic
        candidate, then the democratic candidate receives 55 electoral votes.
      </p>
      <p class='rus'>In total there are 538 electoral votes from all the states, meaning that a presidential
        candidate needs 270 (50.1%) electoral votes to be elected.</p>
      <p class='rus'>In comparison, the popular vote is the total number of people that voted for a candidate.
      </p>
      <p class='rus'>Therefore it is possible for a candidate to receive the majority in the popular vote, but
        still lose the election, because the election is determined by electoral votes only. </p>
