            <h1 class="bite-title">Euthanasia / Physician-Assisted Suicide</h1>
            <p class='rus'>Euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide is a medical process that ends a patient's life.
                This process is completely voluntary (for both patients and doctors) and often occurs when a patient has
                a terminal (life-ending) illness and is living in pain.
            </p>
            <p class='rus'>The goal of euthanasia is to bring closure to a patient and improve their quality of life by
                eliminating their suffering.
            </p>
            <p class='rus'>Currently, in the United States, there are no federal laws regarding physician-assisted
                suicide. Euthanasia is determined by individual states. As of 2022, 10 states in the US have legalized
                medically assisted suicide. </p>
            <p class='rus'>However this process has raised many moral and ethical disagreements </p>

                <h2>Those who support the right to euthanasia claim the following:</h2>
                <p>Euthanasia eliminates the suffering that stems from the terminal patients having to live in chronic
                    pain until their death. Therefore, euthanasia allows patients to end their suffering ealier with the
                    same outcome that would arrive naturally (death). </p>
                <p>A patient is require to give informed consent for euthanasia, meaning that nobody can decide to
                    perform the procedure exept for the patient. Additionally, if a doctor does not want to perform the
                    euthanasia, they have the right to deny the procedure and allow another doctor to fill in.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="double-col">
                <h2>Those who oppose the right to euthanasia argue the following:</h2>
                <p> When doctors complete their education, they take what is known as the Hippocratic Oath. This oath
                    swears to treat patients to the best of their ability and preserve life. Therefore a doctor should
                    not be involved in euthanasia (which ends a patientâ€™s life).
                </p>
                <p>In society, laws are created to preserve and give value to every individual's life. Therefore, it is
                    not ethical to legalize a procedure that ends a person's life. Medical treatments should provide
                    patients with the best quality of care, until they pass away naturally. </p>
