            <h1 class="bite-title">Universal Health Care</h1>
            <p>As medical technology has advanced, medicine and medical procedures have become <strong>more
                    expensive</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Healthcare is a <strong>form of insurance</strong> that contributes to payment or covers the payment of
                medical procedures with the aim to <strong>improve quality of life</strong> and <strong>prevent the
                    financial burden</strong> of medicine. </p>
            <p>In the United States, most citizens receive healthcare from their employers, however, <strong>not
                    everyone can afford health insurance</strong>. This has created the movement in support of
                <strong>government-funded health insurance</strong>, which would provide citizens with free healthcare
                (aka universal healthcare).

                <h2>Those in support of universal healthcare argue: </h2>
                <p><b><br>Health is a universal right.</b><br> After all, Universal healthcare is morally correct as it
                    ensures that everyone can afford services such as ambulances, surgeries, and routine medical
                    check-ups. After all, Health should be a universal right, not something determined by wealth.
                </p>
                <p>The right to healthcare is an internationally recognized human right, supporting the idea that health
                    insurance should be provided by the government for all.
                </p>
                <p>If everyone has access to healthcare, the country is more economically stable, as jobs are affected
                    less if citizens don't have to worry about their access to medical aid.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="double-col">
                <h2>Some, however, argue against universal healthcare and would rather support a system where each
                    citizen pays for their own private insurance. Their reasoning is as follows: </h2>
                <p><br>Universal healthcare provided by the government would cost much more money. This would lead to the
                    increase of taxes for citizens. Therefore many people are angry that people who pay more taxes will
                    receive the same healthcare plan as those who pay minimal taxes.
                </p>
                <p>If the government provides healthcare for all, then the quality of health insurance would
                    significantly decrease. With private health insurance, citizens can choose specific plans based on
                    their needs which can provide a high quality of care (for more money). However, in a
                    government-funded system, healthcare becomes more general and therefore has lower quality overall.
                </p>
                <p>Universal healthcare would increase wait times for medical aid, as more people will use medical
                    services covered by universal health insurance.
