      <h1 class="bite-title">George Santos Inccident </h1>
    <p>In the 2022 Midterm election, <b>George Santos was elected to represent New York's 3rd Congressional District</b> in the House of Representatives. Santos aligned himself with the Republican party, and through his election victory, <b>Republicans gained the majority in the House</b> of Representatives by only nine representatives. 
<br><br>
However, shortly after Santos was elected, questions started to come up about the various claims that the candidate made during the election. Santos had a <b>very impressive resume</b>, stating that he graduated from Baruch College, and then continued to work for major New York firms such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. Santos also stated that he was a successful financier and founded an animal rescue charity. His impressive background continued beyond his professional life. Santos repeatedly claimed to be a proud “American Jew” whose parents escaped the holocaust. 
<br><br>
However, according to fact-checkers and researchers, <b>all of the claims listed above were lies.</b> There are no records of Santos graduating from Baruch College, no records of his claimed jobs, and no records of his “charity.” His family information was also a lie. Santos is not Jewish, and his parents are not holocaust survivors. Santos’s family has been traced back to Brazil, where he has allegedly been charged with check fraud. 
<br><br>
Nevertheless, Santos <b>refuses to admit that he did anything wrong</b>, and has emphasized that he is not a criminal, despite his charges in Brazil. 
<br><br>
As a result of these lies, Santos has faced harsh pressure from Democrats and some Republicans to resign in disgrace. If Santos were to resign, however, it would be <b>likely that the seat would go to a Democratic candidate</b>. Because of this, many Republicans, including Kevin McCarthy (Speaker of the House) have not called for Santos’s resignation because they want to keep their majority in the House. 
<br><br>
Santos has not resigned, but he is <b>being investigated</b> by local and federal prosecutors. Although it is not illegal to lie to win an election, investigators are looking into Santos’s finances which have historically been questionable. A crime that has to do with his finances could be enough reason for the House to force Santos to resign or remove him from office entirely. </p>
