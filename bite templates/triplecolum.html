                            <p class='rus'>The US government is divided into <b>3 branches</b> (<b>executive,
                                    legislative, and
                                    judicial</b>), each of which has their own specific jobs. Each of the three branches
                                of government
                                <b>"checks" (ie, blocks) the power of the other two</b>, so that no one branch can
                                become too powerful.
                                The president (executive) can <b>veto laws</b> passed by Congress (legislative), and
                                also <b>choose the
                                    judges</b> in the Supreme Court (judiciary). Congress can <b>overturn a presidential
                                    veto</b> if 2/3
                                of the members vote to do so. The Supreme Court <b>can declare laws</b> passed by
                                Congress and the
                                president <b>unconstitutional</b>, and hence, invalid.
