<div class="bite">
    <section>
        <h2>Has a strong emphasis on individual freedoms and autonomy</h2>
        <p>Desires minimal and limited government involvement in society</p>
        <p>Libertarian emphasis on individual freedoms strongly supports a free market economy and a capitalist society.
        </p>
        <p>Common political beliefs: Equality for all people, the criminal justice system must be reformed, pro-second amendment (right to bear arms), support for peaceful and organized immigration, and the belief that healthcare should be removed from government control
        </p>
        <p>Example: A citizen votes against gun control legislation because they are opposed to the government interfering with their lifestyle.

<!-- Socialism -->

<h1  class="bite-title">Socialism</h1>
<div class="bite">
    <section>
        <h2>Aims to eliminate exploitation of the working class through the elimination of competition in production</h2>
        <p>Means of production and natural resources are owned collectively by the people and a democratically elected government but private ownership of personal property still exists</p>
        <p>Society has classes (some people own more than others) but equality between the classes is maintained</p>
        <p>Common political beliefs: freedom of religion, equality for everyone, universal healthcare, pro-choice legislation, and environmental sustainability</p>
        <p>Socialism is considered the “middleman” between the extremes of capitalism and communism</p>
        <p>Example: A citizen works at a steel production factory that is owned by the government, but returns home to a house on private property </p>

<h1  class="bite-title">Communism (Marxism)</h1>
<div class="bite">
    <section>
        <h2>Marxists believe that a violent and forceful social revolution must take place to achieve a perfect communist society</h2>
        <p>All property is owned by the government, including both the means of production and the property of citizens.
        </p>
        <p>A communist society completely eliminates competition: no classes, no inequalities, no money, no religion. </p>
        <p>The government distributes resources to the people based on their needs.
        </p>
        <p>Though many countries have been named as “communist” (Ex: Soviet Union), no country has ever achieved a truly classless and communist society.</p>
        <p>Example: A citizen works at a steel factory that is owned by the government, and lives in a home owned by the community. This person does not get money for their work (money doesn’t exist) but receives needed supplies from the government </p>

<!-- Anarchism -->

<h1  class="bite-title">Anarchism</h1>
<div class="bite">
    <section>
        <h2>The belief that government is unnecessary and harmful to citizens and therefore should be abolished</h2>
        <p>Citizens can achieve true freedom and prosperity through the abolition of government
        </p>
        <p>Can be seen as the more radical form of libertarianism
</p>
        <p>Example: A person living in a state of anarchy has the freedom to do what they want, whenever they want, but does not receive the organization of infrastructure and resources that a traditional government would supply.

<!-- Nationalism -->

<h1  class="bite-title">Nationalism</h1>
<div class="bite">
    <section>
        <h2>The belief that government is unnecessary and harmful to citizens and therefore should be abolished</h2>
        <p>Nation: a large group of people united by common features (culture, descent, history, language) in a state or country
        </p>
        <p>A strong sentiment that a nation and those who are loyal to that nation are superior to other nations and their interests. 
        </p>
        <p>Nationalism is based on the desire to maintain the identity of a group of people
        </p>
        <p>Very often tied to discrimination as one group feels superior over another such as white nationalism (the belief that white people are superior to other races) or cultural nationalism (the belief that one culture is superior to another)</p>
        <p>Example: A citizen from a country has pride in their nationality and strongly opposes immigration from surrounding nations. They aim to maintain a society where everyone shares a common pride and loyalty to that nation and hopes to keep “foreigners” away.
        </p>
        <p>*Not all nationalism is extreme or discriminatory. Simply supporting a sports team from one's country can be considered a form of nationalism.

<!-- Authoritarianism -->

<h1 class="bite-title">Authoritarianism</h1>
<div class="bite">
    <section>
        <h2>A system in which a powerful government restricts individual freedoms and expects submission to authority from its citizens.</h2>
        <p>Authoritarian is an umbrella term for many types of government: Fascism, Dictatorship, and Absolute Monarchy
        </p>
        <p>Absolute Monarchy: a government that  is controlled by a fully controlled family (King and Queen) rather than a political party</p>
        <p>Fascism: an extremely authoritarian regime based on ethnic-nationalism (prominent in WW2 era) 
        </p>
        <p>Dictatorship: an authoritarian government led by a single person who often puts even more restrictions on the public (Ex: brainwashing)</p>
        <p>Example: A citizen is stripped of their rights and must obey their government under threat of consequences. The citizen receives little to nothing while the government gets whatever it wants.

<h1 class="bite-title">Welfare Capitalism</h1>
<div id="doom" class="bite">
    <section>

<p><b>Capitalism: an economic system where trade and manufacturing are owned privately (i.e. by individuals or groups of people) as opposed to the government.</b><br><br>Maintains private ownership while prioritizing social welfare policies. Social welfare programs include universal (tax-funded) healthcare, childcare, university, and different types of insurance, as well as generous financial and housing aid for the poor.  <br><br>

Proponents of welfare capitalism argue that it preserves economic growth and competition while lessening the class divide and improving quality of life for the poor.<br><br>

Some critics on the left argue that this system maintains many of the flaws of capitalism such as the valuing of money over high employee wages/rights and ethical production and products. Some on the right disapprove of the high taxes on the wealthy and the possibility of some people not being incentivized to work if they receive welfare (leading to a labor shortage, which would be bad for the economy).<br><br>

Example: a citizen doesn't have to pay for healthcare or their child's university, and a wealthy business owner loses over half of their income to taxes.</p>

<!-- Conservatism -->

<h1 class="bite-title">Conservatism</h1>
<div class="bite">
    <section>
        <p><b>Conservatism is an ideology that is in favor of moderate, slow, and steady change, rather than the fast-paced and extreme change that liberalism and other ideologies champion.</b><br><br>

As the name suggests, conservatives stick with the “tried and true” methods of governance (running the government), preferring political stances that are in line with tradition and don’t stray from established laws or traditional politics.<br><br>

Conservatism is a very broad label, though in the United States and many other western countries, it refers to the ideas of the political “right” as opposed to the “left” - the right tends to support traditional values.<br><br>

Common beliefs: nationalistic (see above), support a strong emphasis on individual rights, generally pro-religion and pro-life, supportive of the capitalist system. In strong opposition to gun regulations, secularization (less religiousness) and socialism.<br><br>

Example: A citizen believes that the right to bear arms (have guns) as stated in the constitution is a human right that the government can not take away.</p>
