      <h1>Who Are We?
      </h1>
      <p>Crash Politics is a a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization made up of high school students who aim to make it
        easier for teens to keep up with politics. We post frequent “Bites” or bite-sized articles about current events,
        ideologies, government basics, and popular political debates. Our “Bites” efficiently present both sides of the
        argument and are articulated to be as objective as possible. These summaries provide a simple and convenient way
        for teens to fulfill their civic duty and be updated with the political world instead of being overwhelmed by
        the thousands of in-depth news articles published each day, which don’t promote an easy avenue to turn political
        awareness into something habitual.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>What Do We Do?
      </h1>
      <p>We operate both through this website and in-person presentations and workshops at middle schools. Our
        curriculum is created and taught entirely by high school students. By doing so, any jargon that can be
        characteristic of some news sites is eliminated. After all, who knows what teens understand better than teens
        themselves? Also, a huge benefit to in-person presentations is the provided convenience that usually bars teens
        from keeping up with politics. Information is now being directly discussed in their own classrooms; the Crash
        Politics curriculum is designed to be like a history class — except about the present.
