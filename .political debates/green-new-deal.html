      <h1 class="bite-title">The Green New Deal Debate</h1>
<p>The <b>Green New Deal</b> is a resolution that forms a <b>plan to tackle climate change</b> by using less fossil fuels, producing less greenhouse gas emissions, and creating new jobs in clean energy industries. <br>
Over the years, there have been <b>many plans</b> to solve the issue of climate change. In 2018, the <b>youth activism group</b> the Sunrise Movement protested outside the office of Nancy Pelosi, the current speaker of the house, to <b>demand action</b >. Currently, little government action is being taken to combat climate change, and the Green New Deal <b>has not been passed</b> by congress.<br>
Many Americans believe that the Green New Deal is <b>necessary</b> to win the fight against climate change. Others think that we should <b>not be putting money</b> into something when there are so many other <b>more urgent problems</b> in our country that need to be addressed.</p>

          <h4>Those <b>opposing</b> the Green New Deal argue:</h4>
          <p>Climate change is <b>not as severe</b> a threat as it is being made seem; this resolution is unnecessary.<br>
This will cause Americans to <b>lose jobs</b>, as fossil fuel industries would need to be scaled back.<br>
This resolution is not clear enough; it needs to be better defined before it is supportable. There needs to be a clear plan in place for climate change.<br>
Money should not be poured into a long-term threat when there are <b>so many other problems</b> that require financial assistance.

          <h4>Green New Deal <b>supporters</b> argue:</h4>
          <p>We need to take <b>immediate action</b> against climate change, and this resolution will <b>hold our government accountable.</b> This group believes that climate change cannot be stopped unless the government makes <b>major changes</b> to the way we run the country.<br>
The Green New Deal will create jobs for many Americans in clean energy fields.<br>
This resolution will <b>protect future</b> generations, and without it, we are putting those generations in danger.<br>
The price of this resolution is <b>justified</b> when you think about how much it will help our country in the long run.
