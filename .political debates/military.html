      <h1 class="bite-title">Military Draft</h1>
      <p>Although the United States military has been volunteer-based since 1973, many have argued that an act of
        Congress should reinstate conscription, otherwise known as the draft. This is a system in which eligible
        18-25-year-olds are required to serve in the military. Eligibility is determined by an evaluation of mental,
        physical, and moral fitness. As of now, 49 countries have required military service, and many wonder if the
        United States should join that list.

        <h4><b>Those who believe the draft is moral argue that:</b></h4><br>
        <p>
  <h2><b>Service within the military brings together many people from different backgrounds</b></h2>
        <ul>
        
          <li>It is argued that the current dysfunction within our society would be decreased because national service,
            such as the draft, breaks down barriers of race, income, geography, class, and language.
          </li>
          <li>There have been many lived-out examples of this unity in many European countries: Switzerland has four
            official languages and three major ethnic groups and is known to be one of the happiest places in the world.
          </li>
          <li>No social status will be taken into consideration, since everyone who is eligible will be included in the
            list.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><b>It saves money for the government </b></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A requirement would eliminate the need to create marketing plans of convincing people to join the
            military. There would be no need to promise free college tuition or salary bonuses. </li>
          <li>In general, national service is a worthy investment: the Center for Benifit-Cost Studies in Education
            found that although U.S. youth national service programs annually cost $1.7 billion dollars, it has a
            returned value of $6.5 billion dollars. This is a similar concept in relation to the draft.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2><b>It builds moral character</b></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The draft would teach the youth how to be respectful to authority, to lead, and practice self-discipline.
            These are beneficial traits applicable to nearly every aspect of life.
          </li>
          <li>This build-up of character can decrease unemployment in the long run because people will have a greater
            sense of responsibility and duty.</li>
          <li>It is a structured opportunity that will allow them to feel needed and capable. Meeting people from other
            nationalities will also help them broaden their views and practice compassion.
          </li>
        </ul>

        </p>

        <h4>Those who believe the draft is immoral argue that:</h4><br>
        <p>
        <h2><b>It’s inefficient</b></h2>
        <ul>

          <li>Some argue that members of the military are satisfied with the professional soldiers, and that drafting
            the youth would be similar to “baby-sitting” teenagers who will leave the miltary after six months to two
            years. It is seen as an unworthy investment.</li>
          <li>In addition, the 2017 Pentagon date states that 71% of Americans between ages 17 and 24 were ineligible to
            serve in the military. There are many disqualifying factors such as obesity, no high school diploma or a
            criminal record.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> <b>It infringes on the constitutional right to choose what to do with our lives</b></h2>
        <ul>

          <li>Although it is stated that the government can “raise and support Armies,” there is no constitutional
            backing to requiring citizens to join the army. In fact, many argue that it would fit the definition of
            involuntary servitude.</li>
          <li>A required duty like this would contradict the very value that brings many people to America - individual
            liberty. </li>
        </ul>
<h2> <b>It is a huge inconvenience in personal lives</b></h2>
        <ul>

          <li>Mandatory service would be a huge interruption to these people’s families and communities who many rely on
            them to contribute to household income, babysitting, or caring for sick relatives. It would also delay
            people’s entry into the workforce. </li>
          <li>Many people’s prime years would be taken away, which will stand in the way of many people’s personal and
            occupational aspirations. </li>
        </ul>
