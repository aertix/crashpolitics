      <h1 class="bite-title">Israeli-Palestinian conflict</h1>
      <p>
        The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has brewed for thousands of years, but it ignited into a highly controversial
        topic in the early 1900s. It is a severe conflict over whether the Israelis or Palestinians have a true claim to
        the state of Israel (which is also referred to as Palestine by Palestinians). The central question is, “Who gets
        the land?”
        <br><br>
        Many Jewish people came to the territory to escape persecution (severe hostility and violence based on religion
        etc.) in Europe and wanted to create a national homeland. However, the Arab people who lived there resisted,
        because they thought the land was rightfully theirs. There was an attempt from the United Nations to divide the
        land between the two groups, but it quickly failed. This then sparked several wars between the Arab and Jewish
        people.
        <br><br>
        The War of 1967 is of special interest, as it gave Israel control of <b>the West Bank</b> and <b>Gaza Strip.</b>
        Because those two pieces of land are highly populated by Palestinians, the conflict has further erupted. For
        example, although the West Bank is labeled to be under Palestinian authority, it is highly controlled by Israeli
        troops who enforce many restrictions on Palestinian movements and activities.
        <br><br>
        Future solutions are looking very black-and-white. One method is the “two-state solution”, which would give Gaza
        and most of the West Bank to Palestine and the rest to Israel. However, details have never been able to be
        agreed on. The second method is the “one-state solution”, which would give the entire territory over to a
        singular group. This lack of compromise is looking more probable as political tensions skyrocket.

        <h4><b>There are two prominent organizations to pay special focus to: Hamas and The Palestinian Liberation
            Organization (PLO).
          </b></h4><br>
        <p>
        <h2><b></b></h2>
        <ul>

          <li><b>Hamas</b> was founded in 1987 to be a Palestinian political organization, and it has since then
            declared war on Israel. Suicide bombings and rocket attacks have become its systematic method of attack. In
            2017, it revised its initiative to seek the transfer of only the West Bank and Gaza Strip, instead of the
            entire territory. However, it still does not recognize the legitimacy of Israel. Hamas and Israel have
            fought through a series of battles in Gaza: an air campaign and ground invasion (2008-2009), a major bombing
            campaign (2012), and air/ground assaults (2014).
          </li>
          <li><b>The Palestinian Liberation Organization</b> was founded in 1964 and is the head of representation of
            the Palestinian people. They are known as the official authority tasked with managing territorial disputes.
            In 1993, they changed their initiative of destroying Israel in exchange for Israel recognizing the
            organization as the legitimate representative of Palestinians. The PLO is responsible for the start of
            possible peace negotiations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>However, peace negotiations have been very unsuccessful for a few reasons: </h4><br>
        <p>
        <h2><b>
          </b></h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Palestinians have had no solid, unified voice.</b> The competition between Hamas and the PLO undermines
            each other’s power. For example, when Hamas gained a slight majority in the Palestinian elections and
            thereby legislative power, they refused to accept previous deals the PLO had made with Israel. This results
            in much disunity within the same group advocating for the same thing.</li>
          <li><b>There is a deep history that is perceived to be unforgivable</b>. For example, the 1948 war displaced
            700,000 Palestinians from their homes, which created a refugee crisis that still remains to this day. This
            is referred to as <b>Nakba</b>, Arabic for “catastrophe”. Many urge for a “right of return” to their
            abandoned homes. Details on financial compensation and limited resettlement in Israel have been debated to
            no success by both sides.
