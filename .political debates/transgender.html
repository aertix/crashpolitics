      <h1 class="bite-title">Transgender Women In Sports</h1>
     <p>As the U.S. actively tries to be a more inclusive country, the road to equality for female athletes is expanded. However, there has recently been debate over the treatment and fairness of allowing transgender women to compete in sports. The conversation has especially been centered around Lia Thomas, a transgender woman who swam for the University of Pennsylvania. From 2017 - 2020, she swam for the men’s swim team and then switched to competing on the women’s team in 2021. Her national recognition and record-breaking success have caused notable attention, and legislators have even introduced bills that would prohibit transgender athletes in women’s sports. Let’s find out why.
<br><br>
Disclaimer: As of now, there is conflicting research regarding the decrease of muscles and strength after taking hormone-repressors. More research is needed especially regarding the role of puberty, but those case studies would involve children, which makes this a uniquely difficult case.

        <h4>Some think that transgender women should be able to compete because they believe that:</h4>
        <p>
Once people go through treatment in order to transition, <b>they don’t retain the athletic benefits from the original gender </b>. A study in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism showed that people taking testosterone-suppression treatments (treatments to help transition from male to female) gained fat in areas such as the hips, things, and buttocks. This decreases their initial genetic advantage. Britain's Loughborough University also found that hormone therapy reduced trans women's hemoglobin levels (which affects endurance) to equal that of cisgender women within four months. <br>
 <b>Some transgender women transition before puberty </b>, so most advantages don’t actually trasfer into sports competitions. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) itself notes that transgender girls who do so, do not get male characteristics. <br>
Having advantages from being a transgender woman does not equate to being uniquely  <b>well-built for her sport </b>. For example, Choie Jonnson is transgender woman who is only 5’4’’, which means that there is a high probability that many female-born competitors will be taller and larger than her. In addition, every elite swimmer has a genetic advantage. Michael Phelps, a 23-time Olympic gold-medal swimmer, has very unique measurements (such as height and wing-span) which are beyond the average person’s makeup. However, there is no protest against Phelps competing.<br>
In the NCAA’s 40 years of requiring “sex verification” procedures, there has been  <b>no proof of a man pretending to be a woman in order to gain a competitive advantage </b>.

        <h4>Some think that transgender women shouldn’t be able to compete because they believe that:</h4>
        <p>
 <b>It isn’t fair because there are physiologic advantages </b> that a transgender woman has over a cisgender woman, <b>regardless of hormone treatment </b>. For example, research that was published in the European Society of Endocrinology found that even though one year of hormone treatments will result in a significant decrease of thigh muscle, transgender women will still have more muscle than cisgender women three years after starting treatment. This especially applies to transgender women who transition after puberty, as they were born with average male muscle mass and strength. Because transgender women have this advantage, it will take away opportunities from cisgender women.<br>
 <b>Some only want to protect this because they want to be politically correct and inclusive </b>. However, this is an issue simply about genetic advantage, not over the identification that a transgender woman may have. A group of Univerrsity of Arizona swimmers recently wrote a letter to the NCAA about how Lia Thomas’ only won because the organization was trying to “appease everyone”.<br>
 <b>Equality within sports hasn’t even been established for cisgender women yet.  </b>The category for cisgender women applies to half the world’s population. This should be prioritized first, and then we can talk about ways to include transgender women which don’t also harm cisgender women. </p>
