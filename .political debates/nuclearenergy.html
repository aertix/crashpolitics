      <h1 class="bite-title">Nuclear Energy Debate</h1>
      <p>Nuclear Fission is energy created from the process of <b>splitting uranium atoms</b>, which causes heat to be
        produced. This heat is then used to boil water creating steam which turns turbines connected to electricity
        generators creating electricity that we can use. </p>

        <h4>What are the pros of using nuclear energy?</h4>
        <p>
          Nuclear energy produces remarkably <b>low pollution:</b> It reduces over 555 million metric tons of emissions
          each year. Considering that global climate change is a pressing issue, this reduction in greenhouse gases is a
          notable contribution.
          <br><br>

          This production also has a very <b>high energy density</b>, which means that it produces much more energy than
          fossil fuels could. In fact, it is about 8,000 times more powerful. This efficiency then produces less waste
          than fossil fuels.
          <br><br>

          This energy also has <b>sufficient fuel availability</b>. Although, this doesn’t mean that we have an infinite
          amount of uranium. Because uranium isn’t renewable, this means we have to mine for it. However, compared to
          traditional fossil fuels, we have a much higher quantity of resources to tap into. We have about 80 years
          worth of uranium reserves to utilize. In fact, at our current rate of usage, we are estimated to run out of
          oil by 2052, gas by 2060, and coal by 2088. The recent experiments with nuclear fusion, which resulted for the
          first time ever in a net positive outcome of energy, show a promising future of theoretically unlimited power;
          however, it will take decades of more experimentation to provide any concrete steps forward.

        <h4>What are the cons of using nuclear energy? </h4>
        <p>
          The reaction process produces lots of waste which is very radioactive. This presents a big issue when it comes
          to the disposal of nuclear waste. Some suggestions are to bury the nuclear waste in underground bunkers deep
          in the desert. However, the waste will always present a danger to its surroundings due to its radioactivity,
          despite where it’s disposed of.
          <br><br>


          Nuclear energy power plants can result in radioactive disasters. Throughout history, multiple nuclear power
          plants have ruptured due to mismanagement of procedures causing radioactivity to spill into the surrounding
          environment. Chornobyl is the main example of a nuclear power plant accident that caused the relocation of
          350,000 people, and radioactivity has been linked to the deaths of tens of thousands of people. While not all
          accidents have been this extreme, nuclear power plants still possess immense potential for disaster if not
          managed carefully.


          <br><br>
          Nuclear power plants are extremely expensive to build. Although many argue that the operating costs of nuclear
          power plants are low, the cost of the infrastructure to create a powerplant is in the billions of dollars.
          Additionally, uranium is not a renewable resource that can be used endlessly. Because uranium mines are
          scarce, uranium is therefore very expensive. Miners also handle radioactive material on a daily basis, so they
          are at constant risk of exposure.
