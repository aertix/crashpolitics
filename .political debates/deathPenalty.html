      <h1 class="bite-title">Death Penalty Debate</h1>
      <p>The death penalty is the <strong>execution</strong> of felons who have committed crimes so cruel that a jury
        unanimously (everyone agrees) decides to sentence the accused to death.
      </p>
      <p>Historically the death penalty was carried out through electric chairs, hanging, or firing squad, which led to
        a painful death. However, in modern criminal justice, the death penalty is performed through <strong>lethal
          injection</strong>, which is a combination of chemicals injected into the criminal to stop the heart.</p>
      <p>The death penalty was instituted as a <strong>harsher punishment</strong> for the worst criminals. The death
        penalty is legal in <strong>27 states</strong>, and the 23 remaining do not sentence criminals to death.</p>
      <p>The death penalty has been a <strong>major ethical dilemma</strong> across American politics.</p>

        <h2>Supporters of the death penalty claim the following: </h2>
        <p>Those who take a life have <strong>given up their right to live</strong>, justifying death as a criminal
          sentence. This can also be seen as the <strong>“an eye for an eye”</strong> ideology.
        </p>
        <p>The more extreme punishment of death is more effective in <strong>setting a precedent</strong> and preventing
          more people from committing horrific crimes. This belief claims that life in prison does not <strong>deter
            people</strong> who have committed crimes enough from committing more violent crimes.</p>
        <p>The death penalty gives more <strong>closure</strong> to the families of the victim(s).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="double-col">
        <h2>Those who want to abolish the death penalty argue the following:
        </h2>
        <p>It is <strong>illogical</strong> to punish a person for murder by killing them. This reasoning is
          <strong>contradictory</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Carrying out an execution is more than <strong>double the price</strong> of keeping an offender in prison for
          life. This costs more for the taxpayers, which can easily be reduced through the abolition of capital
          punishment. </p>
        <p>Realistically, if life in prison cannot deter an offender from crime, then the death penalty will <strong>not
            be able to deter</strong> more crime. Therefore, the argument that the death penalty prevents more crime is
          unjustifiable.
        </p>
        <p>Statistics show that <strong>minorities are disproportionally</strong> put on death row and executed due to
          systemic racism, proving that the death penalty <strong>system is flawed</strong>.
